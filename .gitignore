package-lock.json 
# If you are using yarn and yarn.lock, you might keep package-lock.json if you ever switch
# (Choose one of the above lock files to commit, the other to ignore if both exist, or commit both if your team might switch)
# For this project, assuming you primarily use one, let's assume package-lock.json is used, so yarn.lock might be ignored.
# Or, if you prefer to commit both to allow flexibility, remove the one you don't use from here.
# Typically, you commit the lock file for the package manager you *are* using.
